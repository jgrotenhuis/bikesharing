Hello City Bike investors!  

Thank you for taking the time to hear about some exciting discoveries about the Des Moines market.  
Out of all the questions to address, I chose the one about the population of Des Moines.  Although it is a much smaller market 
in comparison with NYC, it does provide some profitable opportunities to make money.   Based on data collected from NYC city riders,
it's clear that even though Des Moines can't compete with NYC users from a scale/total population, it can offer certain lucratice
segments, such as the potentially large (and mostly male) subscriber base in Des Moines.  Both population and gender are valuable data 
points to consider when decided whether or not to add a City Bike presence.  The total population size of Des Moines (around 217k) doesn't offer much in comparison
with NYC (over 8 million) but it does offer a relatively young, active userbase.   Major takeaway: the population of a city not just
in size BUT also in age/gender distribution are significant factors to take into account, as we've seen from the slide that highlight
differences in "Rider Breakdown by Gender" and "Customer Type by Gender".

Des Moines was recently ranked as the "5th most desirable city to live in" according to a U.S. News report 
(source: https://realestate.usnews.com/places/iowa/des-moines?_ga=2.37966051.1775617935.1598240850-1230811220.1598240850)
for young people in particular, so the ages 20-50 crowd should continue to grow which is where our highest bike utilization comes from.  

## Additional Risks

One potential risk with expanding City Bike to Des Moines is that the state of Iowa as a whole has a strong history of unionization. 
Recent cases of unions and state legistlature trying to bust up or heavily regulate companies like Uber and Lyft California should make our legal team dig into the potential risks of opening a business here.  Most of City Bike's employees (for example, those that charge the bikes/scooters) are 1099 employees and not W2 with full benefits, so it's possible that either the local or even state legistlature would discourage us from either launching the business all together or put into law certain resrtrictions that would make our business model ineffective.

## Summary Conclusion

Overall, I would suggest we open a business there assuming that our legal team looks into the risks of running a business model like
ours in a city and state that could pose legal challenges down the road. 

Thanks!
